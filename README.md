# the-content-full-gatsby
React application created using GatsbyJs and Contentful displaying some of my favourite airplanes (big Airbus fan girl).

## Deployed with Netlify under:

-production: https://the-content-full-gatsby.netlify.app
-staging/preview: https://the-content-full-gatsby-preview.netlify.app

Added the Netlify webhook and Netlify App in Contentful to automatically deploy changes made in the content on either the production or preview environments.

The two environments are based on main and a preview branch.

In the preview environment entries can be seen that were not yet published in the CMS
