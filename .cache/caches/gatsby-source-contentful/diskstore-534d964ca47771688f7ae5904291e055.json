This includes more than 300 commercial flights per day, which take off or land around the world every two minutes.\n\nFlying with the A380 is a unique experience that introduces passengers to new standards of in-flight comfort, from first class to economy. As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, its cabin allows travellers to stretch out in the widest seats in a calm and relaxing environment. With the unparalleled freedom it gives passengers to move about the aircraft, it’s no surprise that the A380 is a favourite in all cabin classes.\n\nThe double-deck A380 makes excellent use of its space to offer passengers attainable luxury. With enough room to install stylish first-class suites, an eye-catching bar or business areas, beautifully inviting cabin lighting and the quietest cabin in the sky, passengers can enjoy every aspect of the flight and, thanks to innovative cabin air supply technology, will arrive at the destination feeling inspired and ready to go. The A380 Forward and aft lower-deck cargo compartments are equipped with semi-automatic Cargo Loading Systems, which operate independently.\n\n##Advanced materials\n\nBy incorporating the latest advances in structures and materials, the A380 offers the lowest cost per seat of any wide-body aircraft, over 15% lower than its nearest competitor. This includes the use of advanced aluminium alloys for the wing and fuselage, along with the extensive application of composite materials in the centre wing box’s primary structure, wing ribs, and rear fuselage section.\n\nThe A380 also uses Glare™ material in the pressurised fuselage’s upper and lateral shells. Glare™ is a laminate incorporating alternate layers of aluminium alloy and glass fibre reinforced adhesive, with its properties optimised by adjusting the number of plies and orientation of the glass tapes. This offers a significant reduction in weight and provides advanced fatigue and damage resistance characteristics."}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"c19cgxnkl95ax","contentful_id":"19cgxnkl95ax"}},"id":"c7xiz3kXD9DVx8qFFdiRLVv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-10-18T21:35:04.626Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:35:04.626Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"airplaneModels","contentful_id":"airplaneModels"}},"contentful_id":"7xiz3kXD9DVx8qFFdiRLVv"},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"Airbus A321"},"slug":{"en-US":"airbus-a321"},"description":{"en-US":"The industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus’ A320 Family – of which the A321 is a member – has been further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions."},"image":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"c1BSNFkEegYNwQyvzwyo2z7","contentful_id":"1BSNFkEegYNwQyvzwyo2z7"}}},"fullText":{"en-US":"##Increased revenue potential\n\nAirbus is offering airlines brand-new options for configuring the generous floor space offered by its A321neo, allowing more flexibility and thus increasing the total number of available seats.  These new cabin options capitalize on recent innovations in cabin monuments and seat design that enable more efficient use of cabin space without compromising passenger comfort.\n\n##Focus on commonality\n\nThe A321neo jetliner – which has a 95% airframe commonality with Airbus’ A320 Family – fits seamlessly into the existing global fleets of the company’s single-aisle product line – an important factor for customers and operators.  The A321neo provides minimum change with maximum benefit for the A320 through incorporation of two new engine choices – CFM International’s LEAP-1A and Pratt & Whitney’s PurePower PW1100G-JM geared turbofan – along with fuel-saving wingtip devices Sharklet™. The A321neo shares a common type rating with other members of the Airbus A320 Family, which allows A320 Family pilots to fly the aircraft without additional training.\n\n##New Engine Option\n\nThe industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus’ A320 Family – of which the A321 is a member – is being further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions. Incorporating Airbus’ “Sharklets” and two new engine choices, the A320neo Family offers maximum benefit with minimal changes from baseline A319s, A320s and A321s – delivering per seat fuel improvements of 20%, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km. or 2 tonnes of extra payload.  \n\nFor the A321neo – delivered to a customer for the first time in April 2017 – Airbus expanded seating capacity with optimised use of cabin space, increased exit limits and a new cabin door configuration. This “Cabin-Flex” option increased the jetliner’s maximum certified capacity to 244 seats, while still accommodating Airbus’ modern comfort standard of at least 18-inch wide seats.  \n\n##A321LR: Longer range on single-aisle routes  \n\nThe A321LR variant provides extended range for the A320neo Family’s longest fuselage version, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm with 206 passengers by utilising extra fuel in three Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs).\n\nIdeally suited to transatlantic routes, the A321LR allows airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft. Operators can outfit its cabin in state-of-the-art two-class configurations – including full-flat seats for true long-haul comfort – or in a single-class layout. The A321neo offers true long-haul comfort, featuring full-flat seats, low interior noise and latest IFE.\n\nThe A321LR’s long-range capability was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2018. The first A321LR was delivered to launch customer Arkia Israeli Airlines in November 2018."}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"c19cgxnkl95ax","contentful_id":"19cgxnkl95ax"}},"id":"c2bQ413ULmr1yHaQ6PM9clV","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-10-18T21:32:55.388Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:32:55.388Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"airplaneModels","contentful_id":"airplaneModels"}},"contentful_id":"2bQ413ULmr1yHaQ6PM9clV"},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"Airbus A319neo"},"slug":{"en-US":"airbus-a319neo"},"description":{"en-US":"The shortened-fuselage member of Airbus’ game-changing A320neo (new engine option) product line – the A319neo – seats 120-150 passengers in two classes or as many as 160 in a high-density layout with a range of up to 3,750 nautical miles."},"image":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"c6lvXiedUt4GrvR9ERUPtPq","contentful_id":"6lvXiedUt4GrvR9ERUPtPq"}}},"fullText":{"en-US":"##Focus on commonality\n\nDue to its 95% commonality with the A320 Family, Airbus’ A319neo jetliner fits seamlessly into the current A320 Family fleets worldwide – which is a key factor for the company’s customers and operators.
