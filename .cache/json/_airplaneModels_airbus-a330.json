As a member of Airbus’ family of wide-body jetliners, the A330neo benefits from continuous investment of over 150 million euro every year – integrating the latest developments from the A350 XWB and A380 Families to maintain its position as the best in its class, well ahead of its competition.\n\nThe A330neo is powered by high-bypass ratio, new generation engines and designed with an advanced high-span wing vastly improving the aerodynamics. New materials have also been used across the wing including titanium pylon and composite nacelle. All these features combined, ensures that the A330neo has the lowest seat-mile cost of any mid-size wide-body and burns 25% less fuel burn than the previous generation competitors."},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/19cgxnkl95ax/7pscxam5cBpL3T7ZKg8de/1f56f167f9f733f7e9bcb7af4bc73c4b/A330-900.jpeg?w=800&q=50"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"airbus-a330"}}
