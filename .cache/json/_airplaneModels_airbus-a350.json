In a typical three-class configuration, featuring the company’s 18-inch-wide economy class seats for modern comfort, the A350-1000 seats between 350 and 410 passengers – who can expect a spacious and quiet cabin, wider seats and elegant ambient lighting that contributes to a beautiful interior while also minimising the effects of jetlag. The aircraft entered into service in February 2018.</p>\n<h2>High performance</h2>\n<p>Designed with airlines' priorities in mind, the A350 XWB meets the multiple challenges of high fuel prices, rising expectations from passengers and increasing environmental concerns. As with the other A350 XWB Family members, Airbus’ A350-1000 brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies for a 25% step change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range competitor. </p>\n<p>Seven metres longer than the A350-900; the A350-1000 features modified wing trailing-edges, larger six-wheel main landing gears, an advanced airframe with extensive use of composite materials, and the world’s most efficient large aero-engine.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"airbus-a350"}}
