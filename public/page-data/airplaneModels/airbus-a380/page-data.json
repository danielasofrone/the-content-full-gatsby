This includes more than 300 commercial flights per day, which take off or land around the world every two minutes.</p>\n<p>Flying with the A380 is a unique experience that introduces passengers to new standards of in-flight comfort, from first class to economy. As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, its cabin allows travellers to stretch out in the widest seats in a calm and relaxing environment. With the unparalleled freedom it gives passengers to move about the aircraft, it’s no surprise that the A380 is a favourite in all cabin classes.</p>\n<p>The double-deck A380 makes excellent use of its space to offer passengers attainable luxury. With enough room to install stylish first-class suites, an eye-catching bar or business areas, beautifully inviting cabin lighting and the quietest cabin in the sky, passengers can enjoy every aspect of the flight and, thanks to innovative cabin air supply technology, will arrive at the destination feeling inspired and ready to go. The A380 Forward and aft lower-deck cargo compartments are equipped with semi-automatic Cargo Loading Systems, which operate independently.</p>\n<h2>Advanced materials</h2>\n<p>By incorporating the latest advances in structures and materials, the A380 offers the lowest cost per seat of any wide-body aircraft, over 15% lower than its nearest competitor. This includes the use of advanced aluminium alloys for the wing and fuselage, along with the extensive application of composite materials in the centre wing box’s primary structure, wing ribs, and rear fuselage section.</p>\n<p>The A380 also uses Glare™ material in the pressurised fuselage’s upper and lateral shells. Glare™ is a laminate incorporating alternate layers of aluminium alloy and glass fibre reinforced adhesive, with its properties optimised by adjusting the number of plies and orientation of the glass tapes. This offers a significant reduction in weight and provides advanced fatigue and damage resistance characteristics.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"airbus-a380"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
