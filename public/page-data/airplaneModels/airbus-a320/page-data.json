The baseline A320neo jetliner has a choice of two new-generation engines (the PurePower PW1100G-JM from Pratt and Whitney and the LEAP-1A from CFM International) and features large, fuel-saving wingtip devices known as Sharklets. </p>\n<h3>Focus on commonality</h3>\n<p>Due to its 95 per cent airframe commonality with the A320ceo (current engine option) version, Airbus’ A320neo jetliner fits seamlessly into existing A320 Family fleets worldwide – which is a key factor for the company’s customers and operators. The A320neo provides minimum change with maximum benefit for the A320 through incorporation of two new engine choices – Pratt &#x26; Whitney’s PurePower PW1100G-JM geared turbofan and CFM International’s LEAP-1A – along with Sharklet™ wingtip devices.</p>\n<h3>New Engine Option</h3>\n<p>The industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus’ A320 Family is being further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions. Incorporating Airbus’ Sharklet™ wingtip devices and two new engine choices, the A320neo Family offers maximum benefit with minimal changes from baseline A319s, A320s and A321s – delivering per seat fuel improvements of 20% by 2020, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km or 2 tonnes of extra payload. With their widest single-aisle cabin, all members of the A320neo Family offer unmatched comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18-inch-wide seats in economy as standard. </p>\n<p>For the A320neo – which was delivered to customers beginning in 2016 – Airbus expanded seating capacity with optimised cabin space and increased exit limits, which allows the A320neo to accommodate up to 194 passengers in a high-density configuration. The A320neo also offers significant environmental performance with nearly 50% reduction in noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft. </p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"airbus-a320"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
