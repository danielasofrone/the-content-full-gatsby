","fullText":{"fullText":"##A European-Canadian partnership\n\nAirbus’ global reach and scale includes the A220 Family, which is now being produced in the Airbus Canada Limited Partnership – held 75% by Airbus and 25% by the Government of Québec.\n\nThese aircraft expand the Airbus single-aisle family to cover the 100-150 seat segment – and respond to a worldwide market demand for smaller single-aisle jetliners.\n\n##High efficiency, low risk\n\nA220 Family aircraft have been specifically designed for the 100-150 seat market, resulting in efficiencies inherent in purpose-built aircraft, and an unmatched environmental scorecard. What’s more, the A220-100 and A220-300 have over 99% parts commonality, as well as the same pilot type rating, facilitating the family’s addition to any airline’s fleet.\n\nA220 Family jetliners were designed using state-of-the-art computational aerodynamics combined with 21st century supercomputing capability; the result is a family of aircraft with optimal aerodynamic performance and efficiency. Powering the aircraft are twin Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the A220. With a bypass ratio of 12:1 – one of the highest of any turbofan engine in the world – the aircraft features 25% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation aircraft, half the noise footprint, and decreased emissions.\n\nTogether, the A220 Family represents the most efficient aircraft in the skies in their class, with low operating costs and low noise levels. This makes the A220 Family aircraft ideal for urban operations and noise-sensitive airports.\n"},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/19cgxnkl95ax/7daoYKUxeCAqXIzfdUoUY5/7826e1e1f97375e5e03bdd147d8eca2a/A220__.jpeg?w=800&q=50"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"airbus-a220"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
